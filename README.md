Solves word puzzles using backtracking search.<br/><br/>

In this problem, you are asked to solve word puzzles using backtracking search. In these puzzles, you have to fill in an array with letters such that certain subsets of the letters form words from a given category. An example of a word puzzle with one possible solution is given below.

![][example_1b]

In this example, the letters connected to red lines should form a word from the "furniture" category and similarly, the letters connected to the green lines should form a word belonging to the "clothing" category. All the words have a length of 3 and the list of candidate words for each category is provided in a word list.

Your goal is to implement backtracking search to find all solutions to a given problem.
